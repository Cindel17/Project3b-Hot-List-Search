# Project3b-Hot-List-Search
The main branch contains the files for the project (including the dataset, font for the GUI, and visual studio project with settings for SFML), while the other branches we were just using to share code while working.

It should be unzipped and stored in the same place as our source code, so that it can be easily read.
